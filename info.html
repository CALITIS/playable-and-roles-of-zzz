        <p>Here are some valuable informations about the Agents in ZZZ (Zenless Zone Zero).</p>
        <p> Starting from our very first characters that we encounter in the very beginning of the game which are <i>Nicole, Billy kid, Anby, and Nekomata.</i> </p>

        <img src=" https://i.pinimg.com/474x/b2/3c/6b/b23c6bb5ae371b3d0b7126bdab1c572f.jpg" height="150">
        <p> <i> Nicole</i> is the founder of the New Eridu Odd-Job Agency the Cunning Hares.

            After years on the streets, Nicole's crafty and cunning behavior has earned her a reputation among her peers as "Even more cunning than a hare".
            
            Despite the agency's high commission fee, the Cunning Hares financial situation is constantly in the red... </p>
            <p> Despite taking on any and all Hollow-related commissions and typically charging a high commission fee, she struggles with finances, leading the Cunning Hares to frequently be in debt, sometimes bordering on bankruptcy. Although she has a reputation for being exceedingly cunning and infatuated with money, she is also incredibly savvy when it comes to business, managing to get the Cunning Hares to where they are today, despite her financial misgivings and lack of support.</p>
            <p> <i>Nicole</i> is initially one of the only clients of Phaethon that was trusted enough with the secret of their real-world identities, affording her face-to-face meetings with the siblings.</p>

            <p> This handsome cyborg with a cool and carefree personality is an avid fan of the Starlight Knight show, not only referring to himself as one of the Starlight Knights, but repeating many classic lines from the show.</p>
            <p> <i>Billy Kid</i>, an AI construct that has passed the forbidden fruit test, is essentially a self-aware machine.
                True to his name, despite having the appearance of a robot, he is quite childlike. Similar to Anby, there are gaps in Billy's personal history that remain unfilled.
                The available information indicates that before joining Gentle House, Billy spent an extended period serving with another mysterious gang.
                As of now, it appears Billy still maintains a close connection with a certain gang leader from the Outer Ring of New Eridu.</p>

                <p> <i>Anby Demara</i> is a young girl whose age and past are a mystery, as is where she learned her highly efficient fighting style. She was taken in by Nicole and joined the Cunning Hares, she gradually became a strong, most trusted companion responsible for combat. Anby loves movies, but due to a lack of common sense, she often believes them real and follows their example.</p>
                <p>She is calm and collected, and unusually competent and efficient in combat, almost as if she'd had years of training. She's has an emotional independence on her ever since.
                    She loves watching movies, but due to certain lack of common sense she seems to almost think them real-life stories. </p>

                <p> "The best mackerel is always the one you haven't eaten yet~" — <i>Nekomiya Mana</i></p>
                <p> An extremely energetic girl whose mischievous side sees her play the occasional trick, though only occasionally~
                    Incredibly curious, with a real love for mackerel.
                    Get to know her, and you'll find she's hiding something behind that cheerful exterior. Nekomiya Mana. Refers to herself as <i>"Nekomata."</i> </p>
                <p> A cat Thiren with feline traits, possessing great dexterity when hunting and an insatiable curiosity about the outside world.
                    Sometimes mischievous, she engages in harmless pranks. But when she sets her sights on a target, her feline-like agility and focus are enough to leave others in awe.
                    She's most interested in other people's wallets.In the past, <i>Nekomata</i> was a member of the long-standing Red Fang Gang. Its leader, Miguel Silver, took on a fatherly role in her life. Nonetheless, due to differing beliefs from the gang, she opted to part ways and go it alone.
                    Following certain encounters involving Nicole and others, she eventually opted to enlist in Gentle House, thus becoming the third member of the team. </p>   
                
                    <p> While progressing in the games main story the next agents that youll encounter are <i> Koleda, Ben, Anton, and Grace.</i></p>

                    <p><i>Koleda</i> is the current head of Belobog Industries, and the biological daughter of the company's founder,<i>Khors. Her father, Khors</i>, vanished due to a scandal involving embezzlement and fled, which severely shook the company, nearly driving it to the brink of collapse. Once she came of age,<i>Koleda</i> willingly stepped up to untangle the mess, rallying the remaining company workforce and resources to revive the financially and reputationally vulnerable Belobog Heavy Industries. </p>
                    <p>Throughout her journey, <i>Koleda</i> amassed practical life experiences and professional know-how, building a circle of colleagues who back her up like family. Yet, to present herself as a leader, Koleda appears to intentionally adopt a stern tone when communicating with others.</p>

                    <img src=" https://i.pinimg.com/474x/10/8a/a5/108aa5d2ee49d6e98bbad560c942e2ee.jpg" height="150" >
                    <p><i>Ben</i> is the financial and asset management director at Belobog Heavy Industries, and one of Koleda's trusted aides. "I enjoy mathematics, but that doesn't stop me from giving thugs a good smack." He's a burly and strong Thiren Despite his tough exterior, he's of a surprisingly sensitive and detail-oriented nature, especially when it comes to numbers.</p>
                    <p> Originally a frontline mechanical operator at Belobog, his talents caught Koleda's discerning eye, leading to his promotion to a managerial position responsible for the company's finances.
                        Grateful for Koleda's trust in him, he remains profoundly loyal to her.
                        His favorite food is black caviar, but he dislikes fish.</p>

                    <p>Strong, Sincere & Straightforward <br> Open and honest, nothing can seem to upset him. </p>
                    <p> <i>Anton</i> is a key member of construction staff at Belobog Industries and one of Koleda's trusted aides."Got a job you can't handle? Leave it to me!" <i>Anton</i> is one of the top brass at Belobog, handpicked by its former president Khors, which makes him a "senior employee."</p>
                    <p> Apart from this, it seems <i>Anton</i> is always talking to his jackhammer, affectionately calling it, "Bro."</p>

                    <img src="https://i.pinimg.com/474x/4e/cd/32/4ecd324358c0f077da40c5819af88c84.jpg" height="150">
                    <p> "Is there something odd going on with your microphone's audio?" <br> "Hmm, it's possible that a stray hair got in..." <br> "Mind if I check your inner parts for you?"</p>
                    <p><i>Grace</i> is a technical expert at Belobog Industries. She's the core talent in developing and patenting Belobog's in-Hollow machinery. </p>
                    <p> She's obsessed with gears, metal and wires — a true mechanical geek. She's eager to dismantle and study any machinery or equipment she takes an interest in: "Such sharp and strong lines, truly beautiful... I can't help but want to open it up and take a look." With some informations that are inside the gane, <i>Grace</i> is probably the only one who can playfully refer to Koleda as "Sweet Pea" without receiving a kick in the shin. </p>
                    <p> <i>Grace</i> always shows extraordinary patience when dealing with machines, doting on the sophisticated metal constructions as if they were her own children. Both of Grace's parents, who were research workers related to the Hollow, disappeared during a dangerous expedition into a Hollow, and were soon presumed dead. She was adopted by her parents former friend which is Knors.</p>

                    <p><i>Lycaon</i> has a troubled past that he keeps to himself.
                        Despite his current elegant and gentle demeanor, the former Lycaon led a wild lifestyle and had a friend whom he trusted implicitly.

                    <p>Lucy prefers to stay in the Outer Ring, seldomly returning to the city. Despite Lucy's best efforts however, her father is aware of her whereabouts, believing that she will return home by herself at some point, as he himself went through a rebellious phase and ran away from home for over a decade, before eventually returning to don the mantle of the family business and responsibilities. </p>

                    <p> <i> Piper</i> is a truck driver for the Sons of Calydon. Apart from driving, she's also responsible for vehicle maintenance and other related jobs. Her tiny stature, cute voice (though she always seems half-asleep when not driving), and adorably harmless appearance (though she's a shut-in who can't be bothered to take care of her own appearance) make it hard to imagine that she would have such a crazy driving style.</p>
                    <p>Usually, by the time she drawls out, "Hold~ on~ tight~," the truck is already barreling down the road. Rumor has it, Piper is a driver who doesn't need brakes. Though riding with her is a terrifying experience, she will always get you where you need to go safely, and in the shortest time possible. Of course, "safely" doesn't include any trauma that may be induced </p>

She is an expert in disguise, infiltration, and other investigative work. She has a bad habit of trolling others and sometimes plays harmless pranks. </p>
                    <p>Jane has a wealth of life experience and can seamlessly blend into any environment, as though she has dabbled in everything there is to do.

                    <p> His impressive profile makes him seem like a genius, but he's actually a hard worker who has had his own struggles. There have been times when he practiced the subjects he wasn't good at until he cried. Seth is quite smart, but his personality often leads to him being taken advantage of by cunning criminals, or sometimes, coworkers.</p>
